=> What is the Difference between webRTC and Socket.IO?

Answer: 
    * WebRTC is a protocol for real-time communication between the browser and the server.
    * Socket.IO is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between the browser and the server.

    * WebRTC uses UDP protocol (User Datagram Protocol)
    * WebSocket uses TCP protocol (Transmission Control Protocol)

    * WebRTC is designed for high-performance, high-quality communication of video, audio and arbitrary data.
    * WebSocket on the other hand is designed for bi-directional communication between the client and the server.

    * WebRTC needs STUN/TURN server to establish a connection.
    * WebSocket does not need STUN/TURN server to establish a connection.
